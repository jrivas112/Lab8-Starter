How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
    Graceful degradation ensures that an application functions even if some features are unsupported. Service workers aid this by intercepting network requests and serving cached content during poor network conditions. This ensures core functionality remains accessible, supporting the principles of graceful degradation and enhancing user experience.
